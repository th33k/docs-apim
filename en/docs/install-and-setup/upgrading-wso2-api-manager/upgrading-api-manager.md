# Upgrade WSO2 API Manager

This document walks you through the process of upgrading WSO2 API Manager. 

## Why upgrade?

There are multiple reasons why you would want to upgrade the WSO2 product to the latest version. These reasons include but are not limited to the following.  

- The current product version you are using is reaching its end of life. To see if this is the case, view the [support matrix documentation](https://wso2.com/products/support-matrix/). 
- You want to leverage the new features of the latest version of the product.
- The version of the product you have does not have certain security and bug fixes that you require.

## What has changed

Over the course of its lifetime, WSO2 API Manager has changed significantly. To learn whatâ€™s new in the WSO2 API Manager 4.5.0 release, see the [About this Release page]({{base_path}}/get-started/about-this-release/).

<div class="admonition info">
    <p class="admonition-title">Seamless product upgrade from WSO2 API Manager 4.2.0</p>
    <p>If you are upgrading from WSO2 API Manager 4.2.0 to 4.5.0, you can experience a seamless product upgrade with no data migration. This pivotal change facilitates a smooth transition for current API Manager 4.2.0 users to the latest version, eliminating the need for complex migrations.</p>
    <p><strong>How to perform the seamless upgrade:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>For All-in-One deployment:</strong> Simply install WSO2 API Manager 4.5.0 in place of your existing 4.2.0 installation. The existing database and configuration will be automatically compatible.</li>
        <li><strong>For distributed deployments (profiles):</strong> Since WSO2 API Manager 4.5.0 introduces separate component distributions (API Control Plane, Universal Gateway, Traffic Manager), you need to:
            <ul>
                <li>Replace the existing API Manager 4.2.0 installation with the appropriate 4.5.0 component distributions based on your current profile usage</li>
                <li>Update your deployment scripts and configurations to use the new component-specific startup commands</li>
                <li>Refer to the <a href="{{base_path}}/get-started/about-this-release/">Key Changes</a> section for detailed component mapping</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>No migration scripts required:</strong> Unlike other version upgrades, the 4.2.0 to 4.5.0 upgrade does not require running any database migration scripts or data transformation utilities.</li>
    </ol>

!!! note
    From WSO2 API Manager 4.5.0 onwards, we no longer support API-M profiles such as, `-Dprofile=control-plane`, `-Dprofile=gateway-worker` and `-Dprofile=traffic-manager`. Instead, we now have separate distributions namely, **WSO2 API Control Plane**, **WSO2 Universal Gateway** and **WSO2 Traffic Manager** components. For more information please refer the **Key Changes** section in the [About this Release]({{base_path}}/get-started/about-this-release/) page.
